# Summarize the project
computer-learner
I created the ConcoleApplication1.zip to input and output a file and write a file
# What i did 
I could not get the program to output the information.
It could not find the input file
I worked with a tutor and she found the file in another location
# How could you enhance the code
I could make this code better by putting more comments 
# What skills will I use to help with other coding
I will copy and paste files in the directory
I will learn to use the source files
