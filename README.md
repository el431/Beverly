computer-learner
I created the ConcoleApplication1.zip to input and output a file and write a file
# What i did 
I could not get the program to output the information.
It could not find the input file
I worked with a tutor and she found the file in another location
# How could you enhance the code
I could make this code better by putting more comments 
# What skills will I use to help with other coding
I will copy and paste files in the directory
I will learn to use the source files

#CelsiusTemperature.txt. for Calculator.cpp, Source3.zip 
#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

Develop code to read data from a text file. Your work should be completed using C++. Read the provided document, FahrenheitTemperature.txt, which includes data on the average yearly temperature for six different cities in degrees Fahrenheit. Note that a space separates each city from its temperature. Assume the cityâ€™s name does not include any spaces or special characters (the name should consist of only a single word). Also assume the provided temperature is presented as an integer. Consider the following steps as you work:
Open the provided file so it is ready to be read. Remember the file is named FahrenheitTemperature.txt. Watch out for the class you use, and make sure it is for reading a file and not writing to a file.
Read data from the provided file. Remember, to read this file you will need to declare a variable. Begin by reading the first value and putting it in the first variable. Then read the next value and put it in the second variable.
Once this is complete, be sure to close the file. This releases the file so it can be used again.

#What did you do particularly well?[
I did very well in creating the output in this code

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have put more comments in the coding.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Function and I went online to find the ansers.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
All of the skill I used in this project can be transferable to other projects or another course such as loops, math problems, and menues.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By finding q way for the user to read the file, declare a variable, reading the first value and putting it in the first variable. Then read the next value and put it in the second variable.
